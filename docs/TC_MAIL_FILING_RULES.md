# Vault mail filing rules

How the Vault decides which transaction file an email belongs to. Brokers never
file email by hand. The system reads every broker mailbox through the Google
Workspace service account, decides each email with the rules below, files it and
its documents, records offers, and only asks a person when it truly cannot tell.

- Rules (code): [`lib/tc/mail-rules.ts`](../lib/tc/mail-rules.ts), version `mail-rules-v2-2026-09-23`
- Enforcement: [`lib/tc/mail-rules.test.ts`](../lib/tc/mail-rules.test.ts). Every rule below has a
  test, and every misfile found in the 2026-09-23 audit is a regression case.
- Index: `tc_mail_messages` (migration `20260923180000_tc_mail_index.sql`)
- Runtime: [`lib/tc/mail-index.ts`](../lib/tc/mail-index.ts), called by the 15-minute CRM Gmail sync
  (`/api/cron/crm-gmail-sync`) and the daily sweep (`/api/cron/tc-mail-sweep`)
- History + cleanup: [`scripts/tc-mail-backfill.ts`](../scripts/tc-mail-backfill.ts)

## Which mailboxes

Every broker mailbox (`CRM_MAILBOXES` in `lib/crm/gmail.ts`): matt@, paul@,
rebeccapeterson@. One email delivered to two broker inboxes is one index row: the
key is the RFC Message-ID.

## The rules, in order

The email's own content decides first. Who it touched only decides when the
content is silent and exactly one open file fits.

| # | Rule | Files to | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Noise never files.** List mail (List-Unsubscribe, Precedence: bulk), auto-replies, listing alerts ("16 new listings for…", "Copy: Subscription…"), our own pipeline alerts ("[Expired]…", "[Deploy]…"), and digests naming three or more street addresses. | nothing | One exception: bulk mail carrying exactly one deal's escrow number (title's automated notices) files by rule 1. |
| 1 | **Escrow or MLS number** of exactly one file, anywhere in the subject, body, attachment names or attachment text. | that file, any stage | Escrow numbers need 6+ characters with 4+ digits; MLS numbers never match inside a longer number. Two files → queue. |
| 2 | **Same thread** as email already filed (RFC References root, or the Gmail thread). | the thread's file | Unless this email names a different file's address: the property wins. |
| 3 | **Street address**: house number + street name ("909 NW Delaware" or "909 Delaware"). Then the street alone ("SW 45th", "Beaumont Drive"), but only in the subject or attachment names, and only for transaction mail or mail from someone on one of our files. | that file, any stage | The city breaks a tie between same-numbered streets; the property in the subject beats one quoted in a forwarded chain. Still tied → queue. |
| 4 | **Who it touched**, only when the content names no property: our client (buyer/seller on the file) or a file contact (title, escrow, lender, other agent, TC firm) on exactly **one open** file. | that file | Open = live, or closed/dead within 120 days of close. A subject naming a property that is not on the candidate file never files by sender. Several open files: transaction mail or mail with attachments → queue; anything else → not deal mail. |
| 5 | **Transaction mail for a property with no file** (offer, counter, escrow, title, inspection, disclosure, closing, with a transaction form attached or a property in the subject). | the mail queue, grouped by property | The daily sweep opens a file when the group proves a deal is under way (escrow opened, settlement statement, closing notice, fully executed agreement). Offers alone never open a file. |

Everything else is ordinary email: counted by the sync, not stored in the Vault.
Email with a client still lands on their CRM timeline as before.

### Addresses that are never evidence

- **House addresses** (`@ryan-realty.com`, `@mail.ryan-realty.com`, and Matt's
  forwarding alias `matt.lists.homes@gmail.com`) never identify a file, even when
  a contact row carries one. This is the rule whose absence caused the
  2026-08-23 → 2026-09-23 misfile (below).
- **Test aliases** `admin@ryan-realty.com` (Vault Test Buyer) and
  `marketing@ryan-realty.com` (Marketing Test Lead) are outside parties, not the
  house, so the test files behave like real ones. Plus-addressing folds to the
  base mailbox (`admin+x@` is `admin@`).

### Which cycle on the file

Offers and counters go to the listing cycle (the offer log lives there).
Everything else goes to the cycle whose window holds the send date (listing or
acceptance, 45 days before, through close + 120 days), a live sale cycle ahead of
a cancelled one. After close, closing mail (recorded deed, final statement) and
general mail are labeled "After closing"; a forwarded "Open Escrow" keeps its own
label.

## What filing does

1. One `tc_mail_messages` row: who, when, subject, body excerpt, attachments,
   category, the rule that decided and why (`match_detail.reasons`).
2. Each PDF attachment (up to five, 20 MB each) becomes a `tc_documents` row on
   the cycle, deduped by content hash (the same signed PDF arriving three ways
   is one document).
3. Checklist: filing never puts a document on the checklist. The document
   reader ([`TC_DOCUMENT_READER.md`](TC_DOCUMENT_READER.md)) reads each new PDF
   within 15 minutes (the form, who must sign, who did, from page images) and
   places only fully executed copies; duplicates and superseded copies go to
   the archive with a reason.
4. One `tc_events` row (`mail_filed`) with the rule, category and direction.
5. The existing return logic runs: an executed PDF from the other side can close
   an envelope waiting on them.

## Offers (OAR 863-015-0250(1), 863-015-0135)

Oregon requires the principal broker to keep "complete, legible, and permanent
copies of all documents … including all offers received" (OAR 863-015-0250(1)),
and a licensee to "promptly deliver to the offeror or offeree every written offer
or counter-offer" (OAR 863-015-0135(2)). Both verified 2026-09-23 at
oregon.public.law. So:

- Every offer or counter that arrives on one of our listings becomes a
  `tc_offers` row (`source = 'mail'`) **whether or not anyone replied**, with the
  PDF filed and linked, and price, earnest money and financing read from the
  offer document itself (a term that does not parse stays empty; nothing is
  guessed).
- One row per negotiation thread: their counter updates it, ours marks it
  `countered`.
- `replied_at`: the first email we sent in that thread to someone outside.
- `presented_to_seller_at`: the first email we sent to our seller about the
  offer. The deal page flags "Not yet sent to seller" until it exists.
- A broker forwarding old mail into their own inbox never creates an offer.

## The queue

`/admin/closings/mail`. Brokers see their own mailbox; the principal sees all.
Rows are grouped: by property (transaction mail with no file: open a file, file
to an existing deal, or "not a deal") and by candidate files (email that fits
several files: one button per file). A person's answer is final: the rules never
re-decide a row a person decided.

## Daily sweep (`/api/cron/tc-mail-sweep`, 13:35 UTC)

1. Re-decide the queue against today's files, then open files where the queue
   proves a deal is under way.
2. For each open file (oldest sweep first): search every mailbox for its address,
   escrow and MLS numbers since its last sweep, all history the first time.
3. Search every mailbox for offer / counter / escrow / closing mail with a PDF
   from the last three days.

## The 2026-08-23 misfile and its correction

The filer that went live 2026-08-23 picked a file from who an email touched. A
SkySlope-imported contact row put `matt@ryan-realty.com` on 56111 School House Rd
as "other agent", so every email in Matt's inbox matched that closed file; a TC
firm, a title officer and an escrow officer on several files sent mail about one
property onto another. Read-only audit, `scripts/tc-mail-backfill.ts audit
--since 2026-08-22`, rules v2, run 2026-09-23 over all three mailboxes, 5,338
unique messages (full counts: [`docs/audits/TC_MAIL_AUDIT_2026-09-23.md`](audits/TC_MAIL_AUDIT_2026-09-23.md)):

| Old filer | Count |
|---|---|
| Filings | 3,295 |
| Agree with the current rules | 89 |
| Message no longer in any mailbox (left alone) | 21 |
| 56111 School House Rd (closed): wrong | 3,077 filings, 88 documents |
| 19496 Tumalo Reservoir Rd: wrong | 77 filings, 27 documents |
| 19571 SW Simpson Ave (closed): wrong | 15 filings, 4 documents |
| 2840 NE Sedalia Loop (test), 20702 Beaumont Dr, 5663 Impala Ave: wrong | 7, 6 and 3 filings |

The same window under the current rules: 372 messages filed across 19 files
(closed files included: post-close title mail and forwarded deal history), 53
queued (52 of them one real transaction with no file, 909 NW Delaware Ave), and
none ambiguous.

`scripts/tc-mail-backfill.ts reconcile` archives those documents with a reason
(archive is the Vault's delete), removes their checklist rows, writes one
`mail_misfile_corrected` event per file, and files every message where the
current rules put it. Nothing is deleted; `tc_events` stays append-only.
