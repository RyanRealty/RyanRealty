# Current — 2026-09-15 (SITE-108 /price-drops — false absence + cap-as-count, cloud session)

Surface: Claude cloud session `claude-cloud-fermi-20260915`, branch `claude/cool-fermi-0paep0`.
Nodes held: SITE-108 (price-drops), SITE-91 (buy, not started).

- **§0 P0 — /price-drops published a false absence.** `getPriceDrops` hands one
  `listing_key` per event to `getListingTiles`, which puts them in ONE PostgREST
  `.in()`. The key list rides the URL. Measured cliff (anon AND service role, so not
  RLS): **530 keys = 14,410 chars → 528 rows; 540 keys = 14,680 chars → `TypeError:
  fetch failed`**. Fetch-layer death, so `error.message` never named it — `fetchTiles`
  threw and `makeResilientCached` cached the fallback `[]` as a real empty market. The
  window held 545 keys, so the page said "No active single-family home … has a
  documented asking-price cut in the last 7 days" while **262 homes qualified**.
  Activity-dependent and silent: the busier the market, the more certain the page says
  nothing is happening. Fix: `KEY_CHUNK = 300` chunked read, union sorted + paged in JS,
  cache key `listing-tiles-v6`.
- **§0 P0 — the cap published itself as the count, live on production.**
  `total` was `capped.length`. Production read 2026-09-15: `/price-drops` **60** (true
  262), `/price-drops/bend` **40** (true 115), `/price-drops/redmond` **40** (true 51).
  Bend and Redmond both reading exactly 40 is the tell. Understates only. Fix:
  `total = joined.length`; `shownCount` now scopes the Dataset's dollar sum + median so a
  48-row figure cannot sit beside a 262-row count.
- **UX / demoMatch.** `V3Carousel` parked prev/next as a static pair under the first card
  — the cream-box tell the table scored `demoMatch: false`. Restored shadcn's flanking
  chevrons, centred on the media midline (measured: media mid 344, chevron centre 344),
  44x44, navy on cream. Barrel var defaults moved to `:where()` so a consumer override
  stops silently losing the cascade — which is also why `/price-drops` cards were 280px
  wide instead of the 22rem the page had asked for since it was written (specs line
  wrapped; hero image 262 → 334, floor is 300).
- **Tooling fixed, not worked around.**
  - `start:ci` hard-coded `-p 3000`, so the `PORT=` its own docs advertise could never
    work. Now `next start -p ${PORT:-3000}`.
  - `check-route-content-floor.mjs` measures IMAGES with a bare `chromium.launch()`.
    In a cloud sandbox Node reaches the photo CDNs through the proxy and headless
    Chromium does not, so every image-bearing route collapsed to `heroImageWidth: 120`
    and floors failed on routes nobody touched. `take-route-shots.mjs` already solved
    this ("TRAP 10"); extracted to `scripts/lib/remote-media-proxy.mjs` and shared.
    Violations went 10 → 6 and `price-drops` now reads
    `words 1800, images 7, hero 334px, jsonLd 6` — **passes its floor**.
- **Pre-existing content-floor violations this surfaced** (NOT from this diff — none of
  these routes render a `.v3-carousel`, verified 0 elements each): `about`
  heroImageWidth 725 < 1296; `compare` heroImageNatural 1365 < 1382;
  `place-type-community` heroImageNatural 720 < 2043; `search` heroImageWidth 160 < 230;
  `team` words 115 < 130; `oregon-city` HTTP 500. Belongs to SITE-90 / 95 / 107 / 110 / 113.
- **Sandbox limits worth knowing:** `sitemaps/listings.xml` 500s locally on a Postgres
  statement timeout (200 on production); headless Chromium cannot reach the Spark CDN
  directly (curl can) — that is what the shared media proxy is for.
- **Judge:** no `grok` CLI and no `cursor-agent` in this sandbox, so the chain falls to
  the claude CLI. Judge = claude-sonnet-5, builder = claude-opus-5. The live table was
  scored on grok-4.6, so this mark REBASELINES the class and the node is NOT done on it.

# Current — 2026-09-15 (Public Patch P0 Tip Ready — place plats + search + rail flip)

Surface: Public Patch on Matthews Mini. Tip Ready locally. **Do not push origin** — Cos Mini lands. HOLD owner email.

- **Tip:** `5149d641` on `tip/public-patch-p0-place-search-20260915` (not pushed).
- **--ship 0:** homepage-v6 · community · place-type-community (demoMatch true; homepage competitiveBriefPass true).
- **Surfaces:**
  1. **Homes in Bend in-card flip root cause:** prior tip only widened hover selectors; chevrons stayed `display:none` until hover (desktop looked like no flip). Now always `display:flex` when multi-photo; SplitCardMedia + enrichHomeRailRows photo stacks unchanged.
  2. **Plats voice killed** on city/community/neighborhood/place-type public copy → subdivision / neighborhood / community. Tip Ready `PLATS_VOICE_REFUSE` in mannered-public-copy / --ship.
  3. **Sisters / Widgi Atlas fold:** pins-first (`fit="dots"`), drop empty plat cells + taxlot parcels from fold; denser basemap framed on dots.
  4. **Search:** MorphingSearch closed trigger is a real typeable input (was empty button); kill Find a home over-label; kill hero inventory lecture + Stage KPI strip; search meta no longer "across" lecture.
  5. **Central Oregon market pulse:** plain claim "Central Oregon right now."; claim-first CSS hides banned KPI tile row; dull ALL-CAPS plot caption cut.

# Current — 2026-09-15 (Public Patch P0 Tip Ready — rail flip live + chrome Search)

Surface: Public Patch on Matthews Mini. Tip Ready locally. **Do not push origin/main** — Cos Mini lands.

- **Tip:** `5769ee12` on `tip/public-patch-p0-card-search-20260915` (not pushed). `--ship` homepage-v6 exit 0 (demoMatch true · competitiveBriefPass true · open-state · catalog-install).
- **Verify + fix (live fail):** HomeListingRail already mounts `SplitCardMedia`; chevrons were `display:none` because hover required `.v3-lrow` (home cards are `.home-rail__card`). CSS now shows nav on home-rail / media hover + `@media (hover: none)`. Address glue: `.home-rail__addr` / `__city` `display:block` (LoopRedmond).
- **Header Search:** catalog `MorphingSearch` via `V3ChromeSearch` (⌘K, suggest feed, icon phone / pill desk). Not house invent. HOLD owner email.

# Current — 2026-09-15 (Public Patch P0 Tip Ready land — card media + inventory + reviews initials)

- **P0 surfaces:**
  1. **In-card gallery + in-card video** — `SplitCardMedia` (homepage Homes rails via `HomeListingRail`, search split via `SplitListingCard` / `MapSearchView`). Photo arrows/dots/swipe; tour/video plays in card media; photo click still opens listing. No hearts.
  2. **Inventory-count lectures cut** — Homes in Bend rail live blurb gone; `/cities` `/communities` `/neighborhoods` `/subdivisions` index captions cut. `mannered-public-copy` `--ship` refuse: `INVENTORY_LECTURE_REFUSE`.
  3. **Reviews AvatarGroup honesty** — `ReviewsAvatarGroup` AvatarFallback initials from real reviewer names only; catalog shadcn/leerob/evilrabbit portraits killed. avatar-open stays Read this review / View on Google / All reviews.
- **Next:** Matt/Cos push when ready. SITE-103/110 untouched.
